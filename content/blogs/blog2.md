Having a passion for cars since a young age, cars are more than just four wheels to me. They resound passion and I believe that cars are lvinig creatures with an engine for a heart. You can feel the pulse of the engine and you can feel the movement while driving.

1. My first encounter with driving came at an early age of 13 when I drove in my grandfather's farm and stemmed the interest that lasts till day and maybe for a life time
2. I learned driving and applied for my learner's permit the day I turned the legal age and got my license 
3. Having drove on Budhh International Circuit which is an official Formula 1 circuit has been one of the highlights of my life 
4. Been lucky to be brought around a family business in the automobile industry, I feel blessed.
