title: About Me
---

I hail from New Delhi, India and had a dream a few years ago to study in a highly coveted global university. Not knowing where the path I took would lead, I just focused on taking opportunities as they came along and luckily ended up at *London Business School* pursuing my masterâ€™s in financial Analysis. A brief look into my history with finance is that my passion for finance stems from my school time, I spent significant time with my grandfather. He used to follow the stock market with strict discipline. His approach was not limited to staying aware of all the current quantitative aspects but based his decisions on the potential movement of market sentiments over the long term. Noticing the cause-and-effect relationships of societal forces on the financial markets intrigued me. I began to explore my interest in the inherent potential of middle-class markets during my internship at a highly regarded local investment house, instead of a corporate giant like J.P. Morgan or Barclays. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how the public responds to the short-term changes in the financial market to achieve their long-term goals. Now that I am here finally pursuing one of the most highly regarded programmes at a world class institution in the financial centre of the world, I intend to make use of this opportunity I was lucky enough to get. I want to learn in this dynamic environment with one of the if not the most diverse cohort that a student can get access to. A few things I am looking forward to are - 

- Learning about the life experiences of people coming from countries all over the world with life stories entirely different from mine
- Learning the subject, I am passionate about from one of the best faculties in the world and visiting professors sharing their real-life experiences 
- Travelling and getting to see the world part by part during the breaks we get after the end of terms
- Explore the city of London and its extremely diverse culture This is a brief outlook about my journey and what I plan to do, thanks for giving us an opportunity to share the same.
